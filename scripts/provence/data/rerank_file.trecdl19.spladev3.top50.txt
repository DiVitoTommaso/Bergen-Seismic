87181	8049855	causes of left ventricular hypertrophy	The chronic exposure to fluid overload and hypertension may lead to cardiac stiffness and left ventricular hypertrophy; some studies have reported an increased risk of death due to inadequate total body fluid removal. Therefore, fluid management should be based on accurate estimation of patients’ dialysis needs.
87181	5753301	causes of left ventricular hypertrophy	In particular, an enlarged heart is a common cause of heart failure. The right and left sides of your heart do different jobs. The right side takes in blood that has travelled round the body and pumps it to the lungs. From here, the blood enters the left side of the heart from where it is pumped all round your body. Because the left side of the heart has to work harder to get blood round your body, it is usually this side that becomes enlarged when your blood pressure is too high. This is sometimes called left ventricular hypertrophy or LVH for short. In other words, it is another name for an enlarged heart.
87181	47204	causes of left ventricular hypertrophy	The underlying commonality in these disease states is an increase in pressures that the ventricles experience. For example, in tetralogy of Fallot, the right ventricle is exposed to the high pressures of the left heart due to a defect in the septum; as a result the right ventricle undergoes hypertrophy to compensate for these increased pressures.

182539	57443	example of monotonic function	Monotonic Function. Monotonic functions are the functions which maintained the order of functions value. As we all know that the variation in independent value also make the variation in functions value. A suitable example for this is monotonic functions or linear polynomials. The monotonic functions maintains the straight line in linear programming graph. This is also called the monotonic nature over the domain and real numbers. A monotonic function increases and decreases over the interval.
182539	57447	example of monotonic function	Montonic Function. When a function is increasing on its entire domain or decreasing on its entire domain, we say that the function is strictly monotonic, and we call it a monotonic function. For example, consider the function g(x) equals x 3: Notice the graph of g is increasing everywhere. Therefore, this is a monotonic function.
182539	57444	example of monotonic function	To solidify our understanding of what a monotonic function is, let's consider what a non-monotonic function is. A non-monotonic function is a function that is increasing and decreasing on different intervals of its domain. For example, consider our initial example f(x) equals x 2.
182539	8757181	example of monotonic function	monotonic function. Monotonic Function. (or monotone function), a function whose increments Δf(x) = f(x′) − f(x) do not change sign when Δx = x′ − x > 0; that is, the increments are either always nonnegative or always nonpositive. Somewhat inaccurately, a monotonic function can be defined as a function that always varies in the same direction.
182539	8757178	example of monotonic function	Monotonic Function. A monotonic function is a function which is either entirely nonincreasing or nondecreasing. A function is monotonic if its first derivative (which need not be continuous) does not change sign.
182539	2909960	example of monotonic function	In mathematics, a monotonic function (or monotone function) is a function between ordered sets that preserves or reverses the given order. This concept first arose in calculus, and was later generalized to the more abstract setting of order theory. 1 Monotonicity in calculus and analysis.
182539	1638687	example of monotonic function	The MONOTONIC function is an undocumented SAS function. It needs no input parameters and if any input parameters are provided, these are ingnored. The function counts the number of times it is called and returns an ascending sequence of integers, starting at 1.
182539	57449	example of monotonic function	The textbook says it's a way of transforming a set of numbers into another set that preserves the order. But I don't understand what that means. Here are a few examples. The question was: do these functions represent a monotonic transformation. u = 2v - 13 (yes) u = -1/v2 (no) u = ln(v) (yes) u = v2 (no)
182539	1638689	example of monotonic function	The MONOTONIC function is often presented as a means of adding sequence numbers to table rows. Several papers present it as a solution to this programming problem. However, the function is undocumented and has some limitations, including:
182539	1307235	example of monotonic function	Here's the definition of the monotonic function from Wikipedia: In calculus, a function f defined on a subset of the real numbers with real values is called monotonic (also monotonically increasing, increasing or non-decreasing), if for all x and y such that x ≤ y one has f(x) ≤ f(y), so f preserves the order.
182539	1638690	example of monotonic function	The MONOTONIC function is often presented as a means of adding sequence numbers to table rows.

489204	1167659	right pelvic pain causes	Abdominal pain can occur in one very small specific area, such as the right lower area of the abdomen with appendicitis. Abdominal pain can also be more diffuse and spread throughout the abdomen. Crampy abdominal pain in the pelvic area can be a symptom of menstrual cramps or endometriosis. Other symptoms that accompany abdominal pain vary depending on the underlying cause. Symptoms can include diarrhea, nausea, vomiting, bloating, abdominal distention, gas, belching, fever and constipation.
489204	678245	right pelvic pain causes	Although pelvic pain often refers to pain in the region of women's internal reproductive organs, pelvic pain can be present in men, too, and can stem from multiple causes. Pelvic pain may be a symptom of infection or may arise from pain in the pelvic bone or in non-reproductive internal organs, such as the bladder or colon. In women, however, pelvic pain can very well be an indication that there may be a problem with one of the reproductive organs in the pelvic area (uterus, ovaries, fallopian tubes, cervix, or vagina). What Causes Pelvic Pain? Possible causes of pelvic pain in both men and women may include: Appendicitis; Bladder disorders; Sexually transmitted diseases
489204	8594276	right pelvic pain causes	Psychologic factors, especially stress and depression, may contribute to any kind of pain, including pelvic pain, but, by themselves, rarely cause pelvic pain. Many women with chronic pelvic pain have been physically, psychologically, or sexually abused.
489204	1759357	right pelvic pain causes	Recently, doctors have recognized that some pelvic pain, particularly chronic pelvic pain, can also arise from muscles and connective tissue (ligaments) in the structures of the pelvic floor. Occasionally, pelvic pain might be caused by irritation of nerves in the pelvis.
489204	6964307	right pelvic pain causes	Organs in the right upper abdomen that commonly cause pain in women include: 1  Gallbladder. 2  Infection or injury to this organ could lead to gallstone pain, cholecystitis, ruptured gallbladder, etc. 3  Liver.
489204	6894988	right pelvic pain causes	The right bottom area also has the colon. A common cause of pain in the morning is constipation -- which can cause pain. Other structures in the area include the pancreas, gallbladder, small intestine, bladder and kidney. In women, ovaries and the uterus can also cause this. The hip bones, skin and nerves in the area can also cause pain.
489204	1430550	right pelvic pain causes	Any malfunction in these organs can lead to sharp pain in the lower right side of the abdomen.

Pelvic pain is more common in women than in men.
489204	6343845	right pelvic pain causes	The pain is due to appendicitis, when you have pain on the right side just above the pelvis and you may also have referred pain around the umbilicus (belly button). The other symptoms for Appendicitis are fever, nausea, vomiting and malaise.
489204	890797	right pelvic pain causes	Ruptured ovarian cysts and haemorrhagic ovarian cysts are the most common causes of acute pelvic pain in an afebrile, premenopausal woman presenting to the emergency room 1. Cysts may rupture during pregnancy (if a very early pregnancy, this may cause diagnostic confusion with ectopic pregnancy).
489204	4890939	right pelvic pain causes	Endometriosis is one of the most common causes of lower pelvic pain, believed to affect 5 million women, or one of every seven of childbearing age. It happens when the lining of the uterus, normally shed during the menstrual cycle, grows outside the womb, sometimes attaching to the bladder, bowel, or kidneys.

1110199	3838638	what is wifi vs bluetooth	Takeaway: Bluetooth and Wi-Fi: Find out what separates these two wireless technologies. Source: Flickr/Dana Spiegel. Bluetooth and Wi-Fi are both methods that provide wireless communication, but the difference between the two mainly stems from what they are designed to do and how they are used. The main difference is that Bluetooth is primarily used to connect devices without using cables, while Wi-Fi provides high-speed access to the internet. Bluetooth is a wireless technology standard that is used to exchange data over short distances (less than 30 feet), usually between personal mobile devices.
1110199	8160520	what is wifi vs bluetooth	Bluetooth vs. WiFi - Range: Maximum range for Bluetooth based wireless connections is 30m while for Wi-Fi, it can extend well upto 100m. In Wi-Fi, range depends on the version of Wi-Fi protocol applied and addition of antennas in the communication system while no such concerns of range or extra antenna are much known in Bluetooth. . Bluetooth vs. WiFi - Devices Connected: In Bluetooth, upto 7 devices can be connected to each other (piconet) while in Wi-Fi, the maximum connections depend on Wi-Fi router which can accommodate 1 to several communicating devices at a time.
1110199	1901879	what is wifi vs bluetooth	Wi-Fi and Bluetooth are to some extent complementary in their applications and usage. Wi-Fi is usually access point-centered, with an asymmetrical client-server connection with all traffic routed through the access point, while Bluetooth is usually symmetrical, between two Bluetooth devices.
1110199	1901881	what is wifi vs bluetooth	Bluetooth 4.0 vs. Wi-Fi Direct: Speed. Wi-Fi Direct promises device-to-device transfer speeds of up to 250Mbps, while Bluetooth 4.0 promises speeds similar to Bluetooth 3.0 of up to 25Mbps.
